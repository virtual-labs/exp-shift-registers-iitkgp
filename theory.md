# Theory:

Shift Register is a group of flip flops used to store multiple bits of data. The bits stored in such registers can be made to move within the registers and in/out of the registers by applying clock pulses. An n-bit shift register can be formed by connecting n flip-flops where each flip-flop stores a single bit of data. The registers which will shift the bits to the left are called “Shift left registers”. The registers which will shift the bits to the right are called “Shift right registers”. Shift registers are basically of following types.

## Types of Shift Registers
- Serial In Serial Out shift register
- Serial In parallel Out shift register
- Parallel In Serial Out shift register
- Parallel In parallel Out shift register
- Bidirectional Shift Register
- Universal Shift Register
- Shift Register Counter

Here our experiment is with serial in serial out shift register only.
